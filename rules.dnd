Experience::text
  Experience points are rewarded for monsters slain (10xp per hit die)
  and for treasure retrieved (1xp per gp).  Experience points are
  evenly divided amongst the party.  If any NPCs accompanied the
  party, the XP is also divided to them, unless they are complete
  non-adventuring NPCs (camp-followers etc. who do not actually do any
  adventuring and just cook meals for example).  Experience points are
  rewarded upon return to "town".  Leveling up requires gold and as
  many days as the new level (so to advance from level 1 to 2 takes 2
  days).

Level up::text
  On level up, you are presented with a choice of 3 special abilities.
  Pick one of them.

  The special ability will describe how often it can be used (maybe all
  the time).

Combat::chapter
  ::text
    First, surprise is checked for. If a side is generally unaware of
    the other, they are 2-in-6 to be surprised.  In a "random"
    encounter, like the party encounters some monsters while walking
    down a hallway, both sides are "generally unaware" and thus surprise
    is checked for both. If both are surprised, then it's like neither
    are surprised.

    In a surprise round, the unsurprised side gets a free round. After
    that round combat proceeds as normal.

    If neither is surprised or they are both aware of each other, then
    proceed to the usual combat procedure.

    Sometimes, one side may be partially aware of the other or
    completely aware but not expecting an attack.  In that circumstance,
    their opponent goes first in the first round of combat instead of
    rolling initiative.  Combat proceeds as normal after the first
    round.

    On the first round, both sides roll a d20 to determine which side
    goes first.  If one side rolls a 1, they can only take one action
    that round.  If one side rolls a 20, they may take an extra action
    that round.  If both sides roll the same number, both sides reroll.

    After the first round, each side alternates.

  Combat Actions::section
    ::text
      Each round, a character can take two actions. However, they can only
      take one attack-type action each round.  An attack-type action is
      defined as an attack, casting a spell, or activating a magic item
      that is attack-like, or any action that describes itself as
      attack-type.
    ::bullets
      * Move: A character can move 30ish feet. Moving out of an enemy's reach provokes an opportunity attack. If it hits you, your move ends. (You can take this action multiple times in one round). Unlike other games, you can't split your movement.
      * Melee Attack: A character makes an attack.
      * Ranged Attack: Make a ranged attack. This provokes from anyone within your reach. If they hit you, your attack is spoiled.
      * Cast a spell: A character casts a spell. Some spells require multiple actions. If a spell requires more than one action, you can cast it across turns, but if you take damage the spell is ruined. Casting a spell provokes an opportunity attack (certain spells specify they don't). If the attack hits, your spell is spoiled.
      * Bull Rush: Make an opposed attack roll against an enemy (referee may grant circumstance bonuses based on size, etc.). If you win, you and the enemy move up to 15' in the direction of the enemy from you, with neither of you provoking opportunity attacks. This is not attack-like.
      * Disengage: This round, you do not provoke opportunity attacks from moving, but you cannot move into the reach of enemies.
      * Defend: Attack-like. You get +2 AC this round.
      * Drink a potion: You retrieve a potion from your pack and drink it. This provokes an opportunity attack. If the attack hits, the potion falls to the ground and shatters.
      * Other: Referee adjudicates.

  Miscellany::section
    ::text
      Prebuffing is banned. There's no justification, it just makes the game less fun.
