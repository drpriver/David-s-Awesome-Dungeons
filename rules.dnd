Experience::text
  Experience points are rewarded for monsters slain (10xp per hit die)
  and for treasure retrieved (1xp per gp).  Experience points are
  evenly divided amongst the party.  If any NPCs accompanied the
  party, the XP is also divided to them, unless they are complete
  non-adventuring NPCs (camp-followers etc. who do not actually do any
  adventuring and just cook meals for example).  Experience points are
  rewarded upon return to "town".  Leveling up requires gold and as
  many days as the new level (so to advance from level 1 to 2 takes 2
  days).

Level up::text
  On level up, you are presented with a choice of 3 special abilities.
  Pick one of them.

  The special ability will describe how often it can be used (maybe all
  the time).

  * +1d6 each level.
  * You die at 0.

  Healing can be purchased at 5gp per hp from a clergyman.

  each.

  Healing by resting heals 1hp every other day, starting on the second

Saving Throws::chapter
  ::md
    Characters start with a bonus according to the below table in each
    category.  The target number for a saving throw is 20. The exception to
    this is that spells originating from magical items are 2 points easier to
    save against.
    A natural 1 always fails a saving throw.
    ::table
      Category        | Description                                                                    | Base Bonus
      Perception Save | Save against a trap or illusion.                                               | +7
      Fortitude Save  | Save against poisons, paralyzation, gases and death effects.                   | +10
      Reflex Save     | Save against dragon's breath, fireballs, etc.                                  | +6
      Spell Save      | Save against non-physical effects like charms, polymorphs. Catch-all category. | +4
    On level character receives 2 saving throw points that they may allocate as
    they choose. They cannot allocate more than 1 point to a single category at a time.

    A character does not save more than once against a single event. Sometimes
    there is conceptual overlap and it is unclear which category to apply.
    Apply the first category in the list, or the referee may make a judgement.
    For example, a dragon that breathes poison gas is a fortitude save. A poison needle on a chest is a perception save.

    all (completely untrained), with the exception of things like
    climbing.

    Skill checks are either gated (you need X in skill to do Y) or are a
    d6+skill roll against a target number.

Combat::chapter
  ::md
    First, surprise is checked for. If a side is generally unaware of
    the other, they are 2-in-6 to be surprised.  In a "random"
    encounter, like the party encounters some monsters while walking
    down a hallway, both sides are "generally unaware" and thus surprise
    is checked for both. If both are surprised, then it's like neither
    are surprised.

    In a surprise round, the unsurprised side gets a free round. After
    that round combat proceeds as normal.

    If neither is surprised or they are both aware of each other, then
    proceed to the usual combat procedure.

    Sometimes, one side may be partially aware of the other or
    completely aware but not expecting an attack.  In that circumstance,
    their opponent goes first in the first round of combat instead of
    rolling initiative.  Combat proceeds as normal after the first
    round.

    On the first round, both sides roll a d20 to determine which side
    goes first.  If one side rolls a 1, they can only take one action
    that round.  If one side rolls a 20, they may take an extra action
    that round.  If both sides roll the same number, both sides reroll.

    After the first round, each side alternates.

  Combat Actions::md
    Each round, a character can take two actions. However, they can
    only take one attack-type action each round.  An attack-type
    action is defined as an attack, casting a spell, or activating a
    magic item that is attack-like, or any action that describes
    itself as attack-type.

    * Move: A character can move 30ish feet. Moving out of an enemy's
      reach provokes an opportunity attack. If it hits you, your move
      ends. (You can take this action multiple times in one round).
      Unlike other games, you can't split your movement.
    * Melee Attack: A character makes an attack.
    * Ranged Attack: Make a ranged attack. This provokes from anyone
      within your reach. If they hit you, your attack is spoiled.
    * Cast a spell: A character casts a spell. Some spells require
      multiple actions. If a spell requires more than one action, you
      can cast it across turns, but if you take damage the spell is
      ruined. Casting a spell provokes an opportunity attack (certain
      spells specify they don't). If the attack hits, your spell is
      spoiled.
    * Bull Rush: Make an opposed attack roll against an enemy (referee
      may grant circumstance bonuses based on size, etc.). If you win,
      you and the enemy move up to 15' in the direction of the enemy
      from you, with neither of you provoking opportunity attacks.
      This is not attack-like.
    * Disengage: This round, you do not provoke opportunity attacks
      from moving, but you cannot move into the reach of enemies.
    * Defend: Attack-like. You get +2 AC this round.
    * Drink a potion: You retrieve a potion from your pack and drink
      it. This provokes an opportunity attack. If the attack hits, the
      potion falls to the ground and shatters.
    * Other: Referee adjudicates.

  Miscellaneous::md
    Prebuffing is banned. There's no justification, it just makes the
    game less fun.

    This is a lot of rolling, so you can automate it by clicking this button.
    You are left to decide your name, class, purchase equipment and choose your
    random first level ability (which only the referee knows the full list so
    he will give you your options once you have decided your class).
